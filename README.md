# med-translate 　 Landing page

The idea of this website is based on my experience when I was working at the hospital.
I saw a lot of struggles that non-native people were having with medical services, as the situation surrounding them was so intense and there were many questions about medical terms. So, I came up with this idea to help them and provide some assurance.

The web site originally made for Japanese customer however,I made the English version so English speaker can navigate as well.
