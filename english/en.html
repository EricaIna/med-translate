Thanks to this service, even someone like me, who doesn't understand English at all, was able to get help immediately. During the waiting time, they helped me with medical care, and the staff was a medical worker, so it was very helpful mentally.

                I needed a substitute for the medicine I usually take in Japan, and I was worried about buying the correct medicine because I have allergies, so I used this. A local pharmacist made a three-way call over the videophone, and I was able to replenish the necessary medicine without any problems. I didn't have to go back to Japan, so it was really helpful.
